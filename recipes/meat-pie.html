    <p>It's often enjoyed as a snack, for breakfast, or even as a light meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g mincemeat or ground beef (18-20%fat)</li>
        <li>700g plain flour, extra for dusting and thickening</li>
        <li>380g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Cube seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>2 medium-size potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 big carrot, cleaned and cubed</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>To make the dough:</b></p>
        <p>In a shallow mixing bowl, add flour, salt, sugar (if using) and butter</p>
        <p>Rub together till all turn to crumbs</p>
        <p>Add 100 ml of water and mix till all is combined. If the dough still needs water add a tablespoon of water at a time till you get well combined dough like in pix5</p>
        <p>Set dough aside in a cool place or a fridge for 30 minutes then you move on to preparing the meaty filling.</p>
        <p>Yes! Making the dough is that easy but remember, DO NOT overwork it when handling.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>To make the yummy pie filling:</b></p>
        <p>Place a pan on medium heat and add oil, heat for 2 minutes, add chopped onions and fry till onion is translucent. Add mince to the onion and stir mince till its brown then add curry powder, thyme, stock cube, a pinch of salt and stir till all combine. Reduce the heat if need be to avoid burning.</p>
        <p>The fat from the mince should make the sauce juicy but if it looks dry, add a cooking spoon (100ml) of water to it. (decant oil if it is too much)</p>
        <p>Add boiled potatoes and carrots, combine well and cook on a low heat for another 3-5 minutes.</p>
        <p>The mince should be well cooked now. Now you move on to thickening the mince.</p>
        <p>Add 2tbsp of flour to a bowl and mix with water to form a paste. Add the paste to the mince meat on the heat and combine well. Leave to cook for another minute. Take off the heat and allow to cool.
        </p></li>

        <li><p><b>Rolling the dough and making the meat pie:</b></p>
        <p>Preheat oven at 180C/350F</p>
        <p>Break the egg into a bowl, whisk and set aside</p>
        <p>Sprinkle a bit of flour on a plain, clean surface/worktop</p>
        <p>Divide dough into 2 or 3 places and roll out flat using a rolling pin</p>
        <p>Place a circle cutter on the flat dough and cut out into many circles you can get. use a makeshift if you don’t have a cutter. Repeat this process with the rest of the dough</p>
        <p>Add the meat filling to the centre of the circled dough, brush one half of the circle with whisked egg and carefully fold over the meat filling making sure the 2 edges touch one another. The aim of the egg is to seal the dough.</p>
        <p>Close edges by pressing down with the tip of a fork as seen in picture (See step by step picture guide below)</p>
        <p>Repeat this process for the remaining dough and filling. Place a foil in a baking tray and rub with oil this stops the pie from sticking to the tray when done. Alternatively use a parchment paper.</p>
        <p>After you have completely filled the pastry, set on a baking tray, egg wash the top and pinch with a fork</p>
        <p>Place in the oven and bake for 20-30 minutes at 180C⁰/350F</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
