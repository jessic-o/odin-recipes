    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Jollof rice is a flavorful, one-pot rice dish popular in West Africa, especially in Nigeria and Ghana. It's characterized by its vibrant red color, derived from a stew of tomatoes, onions, and peppers.</p>
    <p>The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, and various spices like curry powder, thyme, and bay leaves, which give it a distinctive savory and aromatic flavor.</p>

    <h6>For the jollof rice</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup canola or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>2 medium red onions, peeled, halved and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>3 cups parboiled long-grain rice (such as Carolina Gold or Uncle Ben’s Original), basmati or jasmine rice (about 1¼ pounds)</li>
        <li>5 fresh thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>1 fresh bay leaf</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups beef, chicken or vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the obe ata: Working in batches if needed, combine all the obe ata ingredients except the canola oil in a blender and purée on high until smooth. The liquid from the can of tomatoes should suffice, but you can add up to ¼ cup of water if necessary to get the purée going. (You should have about 3 cups of purée.)</li>
        <li>Heat the 2 tablespoons canola oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add the purée and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer until the sauce is slightly reduced by about a third of its original volume, 18 to 20 minutes. (It should make about 2 cups. Obe ata can be cooled and refrigerated for up to 2 weeks, or frozen for up to 1 month.)</li>
        <li>Prepare the rice: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Heat the ½ cup canola oil in a large Dutch oven over medium until shimmering, about 1 minute. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove half the onions to a plate and set aside. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, turmeric and smoked paprika, if using, and toast, stirring occasionally, until turmeric is fragrant and tomato paste has deepened to a dark red color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the obe ata sauce and bring to a simmer over medium heat. The habanero oils love to disperse in the air, so you may want to turn on your stovetop fan or open a window while simmering the obe ata. Stir in the rice, thyme and bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the stock and cover with a lid. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook until rice is just tender, 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the oven and let sit, covered (no peeking) for 15 minutes. Uncover, fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the reserved sautéed onions. Adjust seasoning, if necessary, and discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
